Psysonic is a beautiful desktop music player built completely from the ground up for the modern era. Utilizing **Tauri v2** and **React**, it offers a native-feeling, lightweight, and incredibly fast experience with a stunning UI inspired by the [Catppuccin](https://github.com/catppuccin/catppuccin) and [Nord](https://www.nordtheme.com/) aesthetics.

Designed specifically for users hosting their own music via Navidrome or other Subsonic API servers, Psysonic aims to be the best way to interact with your personal library.

## ✨ Features

- 🎨 **Gorgeous UI**: A large selection of beautiful, lean themes for every taste — Open Source Classics (Catppuccin, Nord, Gruvbox), Operating Systems, Games, Movies, Series, Psysonic originals, and Mediaplayer — with smooth glassmorphism effects and micro-animations.
- ⚡ **Blazing Fast**: Built with Rust & Tauri — native audio engine (rodio), minimal RAM usage compared to typical Electron apps.
- 🌍 **Internationalization (i18n)**: Fully translated into English, German, French, and Dutch.
- 📻 **Live "Now Playing"**: See what other users on your server are currently listening to in real-time.
- 🎵 **Last.fm Integration**: Direct scrobbling, Now Playing updates, love/unlove, Similar Artists, and top stats — no Navidrome configuration required.
- 🎤 **Synchronized Lyrics**: In-sidebar lyrics pane powered by LRCLIB — synced with auto-scroll and line highlighting, plain-text fallback.
- 💾 **IndexedDB Caching**: Ultra-fast loading times with persistent IndexedDB image caching for cover art and artist images.
- 📀 **Album Downloads**: Support for downloading entire albums directly to your local machine.
- 💿 **Album & Artist Views**: Beautiful grid displays and detailed artist pages with related albums and color-coded initial avatars for fast browsing.
- 〰️ **Waveform Seekbar**: Canvas-based waveform with a blue-to-mauve gradient and glow effect — click or drag anywhere to seek.
- 🎛️ **Queue Management**: Drag & drop reordering, shuffle, playlist saving/loading, and server-side queue synchronization.
- ⌨️ **Configurable Keybindings**: Rebind any playback action (play/pause, next, seek, volume…) directly in Settings.
- 🔤 **Font Picker**: 10 UI fonts to choose from in Settings → Appearance.
- 🎼 **Random Mix**: Generate a random playlist from your entire library. Filter by keyword or pick a Super Genre (Metal, Rock, Electronic, Jazz…) for a focused mix with progressive loading.
- 🔄 **Update Notifications**: Built-in update checker (on startup + every 10 minutes) that notifies you when a new version is available on GitHub.
- 🖥️ **Cross-Platform**: Available natively for Windows, macOS, and Linux (including Wayland support).

## ● Known Limitations

- **Linux (drag & drop cursor feedback)**: Due to a WebKitGTK limitation, the drag cursor does not reflect the drop operation type — it may appear as a "forbidden" symbol or show no indicator at all, depending on the desktop environment. Drag and drop itself works correctly.
- **FLAC seeking**: Seeking in FLAC files requires an embedded SEEKTABLE metadata block. Files encoded without one cannot be seeked — clicking the waveform has no effect. Most modern encoders include a SEEKTABLE by default. You can add one retroactively with `metaflac --add-seekpoint=10s *.flac`.

## 📥 Installation

Navigate to the [Releases](https://github.com/Psychotoxical/psysonic/releases) page and download the installer for your operating system.

- **Windows**: `.exe` or `.msi`
- **macOS**: `.dmg` (Universal or Apple Silicon)
- **Linux (Ubuntu/Debian)**: `.deb` from GitHub Releases
- **Linux (Fedora/RHEL)**: `.rpm` from GitHub Releases
- **Linux (Arch/CachyOS)**: AUR — `yay -S psysonic` or `paru -S psysonic`

> The AUR package builds from source using your system's own WebKitGTK — no bundled libs, no EGL/Mesa compatibility issues.

## 🚀 Getting Started

1. Download and install Psysonic.
2. Open the app and enter your Subsonic/Navidrome server details (URL, Username, Password).
3. If applicable, you can provide both an external URL and a local LAN IP. Psysonic allows you to quickly toggle between them in the Settings.
4. Enjoy your music!
