> [!WARNING]
> Psysonic is under heavy active development. Bugs and rough edges are to be expected. We reserve the right to change, remove, or rework existing features at any time without prior notice.

## Server Compatibility

**Psysonic is optimized first and foremost for Navidrome.**

Many advanced functions integrate directly with Navidrome APIs for the best possible experience. Other Subsonic-compatible servers generally work well, but some features may be limited depending on server capabilities.

## Why Psysonic?

Most Subsonic clients feel like web wrappers.

**Psysonic does not.**

It is a true desktop experience built with **Rust**, **Tauri v2**, and **React** for users who care about speed, aesthetics, customization, and serious music library management.

If you host your own music, this is what the premium experience should feel like.
