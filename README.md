---

Psysonic is a beautiful desktop music player built completely from the ground up for the modern era. Utilizing **Tauri v2** and **React**, it offers a native-feeling, lightweight, and incredibly fast experience with a stunning UI inspired by the [Catppuccin](https://github.com/catppuccin/catppuccin) aesthetic. 

Designed specifically for users hosting their own music via Navidrome or other Subsonic API servers, Psysonic aims to be the best way to interact with your personal library.

● Known Limitations

  - Linux (drag & drop cursor feedback): Due to a WebKitGTK limitation, the drag cursor does not reflect the drop operation type — it may appear as a "forbidden" symbol or show no
  indicator at all, depending on the desktop environment. Drag and drop itself works correctly.

## ✨ Features

- 🎨 **Gorgeous UI**: Deeply integrated Catppuccin themes (Mocha & Latte) with smooth glassmorphism effects and micro-animations.
- ⚡ **Blazing Fast**: Built with Rust & Tauri, resulting in minimal RAM usage compared to typical Electron apps.
- 🌍 **Internationalization (i18n)**: Fully translated into English and German (v1.0.0).
- 📻 **Live "Now Playing"**: See what other users on your server are currently listening to in real-time.
- 🎵 **Last.fm Scrobbling**: Full integration for scrobbling your tracks via the Navidrome server.
- 💾 **Local Caching**: Fast loading times with customizable image caching thresholds.
- 💿 **Album & Artist Views**: Beautiful grid displays and detailed artist pages with related albums.
- 🎛️ **Queue Management**: Drag & drop support, playlist saving, and loading directly built into the queue. Server-side queue synchronization is fully supported.
- 🖥️ **Cross-Platform**: Available natively for Windows, macOS, and Linux.

## 🛡️ Security

With the **v1.0.0 Release**, Psysonic has been hardened for public use:
- **Secured Credentials**: Industry-standard security using Tauri's native encrypted store.
- **Hardened Sandbox**: Restricted filesystem permissions to only necessary directories.
- **Native Security**: Disabled global Tauri objects to significantly reduce XSS attack vectors.
